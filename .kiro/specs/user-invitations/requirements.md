# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Invitations feature enables existing company users to invite new users to join their business through email invitations. This feature integrates with the existing authentication and onboarding systems to provide a seamless invitation and acceptance flow. Invited users can join the company without going through the standard email verification process, and the system manages invitation lifecycle including creation, acceptance, and cleanup.
