# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data synchronization across ChatMesh company members. When any data changes within a company (customers, employees, notes, messages), all members of that company will receive immediate updates with complete object data, ensuring consistent state across all company users without manual refresh.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a company member in ChatMesh, I want to see real-time updates when other company members modify data, so that I always have the most current information without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any company member creates, updates, or deletes a customer THEN all other members of the same company SHALL receive the complete customer object via SSE
2. WHEN any company member creates, updates, or deletes an employee THEN all other members of the same company SHALL receive the complete employee object via SSE
3. WHEN any company member creates, updates, or deletes a note THEN all other members of the same company SHALL receive the complete note object via SSE
4. WHEN a customer sends a message to the company THEN all company members SHALL receive the complete message object via SSE
5. WHEN I connect to the application THEN I SHALL establish an SSE connection automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a company member in ChatMesh, I want my actions to use standard HTTP requests, so that the interface remains simple and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create, update, or delete any data THEN the system SHALL use standard HTTP POST/PUT/DELETE requests
2. WHEN I perform any action THEN the system SHALL NOT use WebSockets or other real-time protocols for the request
3. WHEN my HTTP request completes successfully THEN the system SHALL broadcast the change via SSE to other company members

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a company member in ChatMesh, I want to only receive updates relevant to my company, so that I don't see data from other organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated THEN I SHALL only receive SSE events for data within my company
2. WHEN I am not a member of a company THEN I SHALL NOT receive SSE events for that company's data
3. WHEN an employee from another company is updated THEN I SHALL NOT receive that update

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a ChatMesh user, I want to receive complete object data in updates, so that I don't need to make additional API calls to get missing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I receive an SSE event THEN it SHALL contain the complete updated object, not just changed fields
2. WHEN I receive a customer update THEN it SHALL include all customer properties including assigned employee details
3. WHEN I receive an employee update THEN it SHALL include all employee properties including avatar and contact information
4. WHEN I receive a note update THEN it SHALL include all note properties and metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a ChatMesh user, I want the SSE connection to handle network issues gracefully, so that I maintain real-time updates even with unstable connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my SSE connection drops THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect
2. WHEN reconnecting after a disconnection THEN I SHALL resume receiving real-time updates
3. WHEN the connection fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
4. WHEN I close the application THEN the SSE connection SHALL be properly cleaned up on the server
